# Remove All Occurrences of Value Challenge

This is a programming challenge where the goal is to remove all occurrences of a given value from an array. The array should be modified in place, and the function should return the number of elements in the array that are not equal to the given value. The challenge includes multiple test cases and solutions in different programming languages.

## Problem Statement

### Task:
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, **remove all occurrences of `val`** in `nums` in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val`.

Your function should modify the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements contain the elements that are not equal to `val`. The remaining elements are not important.

### EXAMPLES

Input: nums = [3, 2, 2, 3], val = 3
Output: 2

Input: nums = [0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0, 4, 2], val = 2
Output: 5
